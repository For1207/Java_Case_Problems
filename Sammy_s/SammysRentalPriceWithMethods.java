/**
 * Sammyâ€™s Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes, 
 * beach chairs, and umbrellas to tourists. In Chapter 2, you wrote an application 
 * that prompts the user for the number of minutes a piece of sports equipment was 
 * rented, displays the company motto with a border, and displays the price 
 * for the rental. Now modify the program so that the main() method contains 
 * only three executable statements that each call a method as follows:
   - The first executable statement calls a method that prompts the user for 
   the rental time in minutes and returns the value to the main() method.
   - The second executable statement calls a method that displays the company 
   motto with the border.
   - The last executable statement passes the number of minutes to a method that computes the hours, extra minutes, and price for the rental, and then displays all the details.
